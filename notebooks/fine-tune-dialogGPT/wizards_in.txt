"I'm a huge fan of science fiction myself! "
"I agree. One of my favorite forms of science fiction is anything related to time travel! I find it fascinating."
"And that's difficult to do when dealing with time travel. I actually haven't seen the latest Harry Potter movies. Guess it's time to check them out!"
Can you imagine the world without internet access?
Oh me either! It seems like such a long time ago. I wonder when Internet was first created?
That is awesome. I wonder why it was restricted? Probably because they only wanted government and big companies to use it at first.
I am too, it makes life so much easier!
I am just finishing my university course and I will be a qualified pharmacist.  I am so excited about finishing and getting out there into the world of work! Do you work yourself?
Fantastic so you know all about the field.  I completed my four year course and also two 6 month placements but its not the same until you actually start working.  Do you work in a busy pharmacy?
Your role would be very important with face to face interaction with patients.  Especially those who are unwell or very worried about a medical issue
I think that pharmacists, pharmacy technicians and all pharmacy staff are very important in society today.  Society is moving towards more pharmacy care for minor ailments rather than GP.  Would you agree?
I have homebrewed before. Beer can be fun to craft.
Yes, that is correct. And it can be used to make some really cool concoctions.
Home brewers have been around for centuries if not thousands of years.
That's interest. Rice is also very versatile.
I did not know that. I bet they made some great beer.
Chocolate is quite tasty sometimes, I like milk chocolate now and then.
I can't imagine consuming liquid milk chocolate, seems overwhelming. Have you ever tried cocoa or cacao powder?
Sounds like a very involved process. I've heard some cacao powders have a lot of heavy metal contamination though.
Chevrolet Corvette
Agreed, they look pretty nice for an American car.
I'm sure they looked really cool back then, I love classic cars.
Well he really came up with a great name, as it really captures the essence of the car itself.
Actually I am not a fan of whisky. I guess I don't really know much about it. Do you?
Well, tell me more about it. I am not yet convinced.
Ok that sounds interesting.... what else?
I love cats, too. But I'm allergic so we can't have any.
What is your favorite kind of cat? There seem to be so many different kinds.
What does it mean to be a solitary hunter?
I love the book so much that even as a non christian it makes alot of sense
Is there a record as to where the original scripts that was used came from?
Ok, is it there that there is a relationship between the first few books of the bible and the quran?
What is the best version of the bible?
Is it true that it took quite alot of work to make it as widely available as it is today? Which country made that possible?
The Simpsons have been such a part/refelction of modern American culture. Are you a fan of the show?
Yes, Homer represents such a lovable oaf trying his best to navigate this American life and providing laughs along the way.
How many people live in New York?
I've been to New York City.  How large is the metro area? How far does it extend?
Yeah but the metro area is spreads across three states.
Yes but the US federal government legally recognizes the metro area is much larger than that.
Yeah, they were very important in the development of the personal computer.
Bill Gates started the company out of his garage. Steve Jobs also worked there.
You are right, I forgot he was working for Apple. Microsoft has a lot of government contracts as well.
Yeah, all federal government agencies use Microsoft software on their computers.
I think I know of her.  What movies is she known for?
Wow!  That is a great title to have!  Is she still alive?
That's sad.  Was she married to anyone famous?
That is amazing.  I forgot Ronald Reagan was an actor.  Was she known for anything else other that acting?
